//! # What's Ristretto?
//! Ristretto is a construction of a prime-order group using a non-prime-order Edwards curve.
//! The Decaf paper suggests using a non-prime-order curve E\mathcal EE to implement a prime-order
//! group by constructing a quotient group. Ristretto uses the same idea, but with different formulas,
//! in order to allow the use of cofactor-888 curves such as Curve25519.
//! 
//! Internally, a Ristretto point is represented by an Edwards point. 
//! Two Edwards points P,QP, QP,Q may represent the same Ristretto point, in the same way that 
//! different projective (X,Y,Z) coordinates may represent the same Edwards point. 
//! 
//! Group operations on Ristretto points are carried out with no overhead by performing the 
//! operations on the representative Edwards points.
